# Dockerfile Fix for PostgreSQL Remote Database

## 🐛 Issue

The Docker build was failing with the error:
```
npm error The `npm ci` command can only install with an existing package-lock.json or
npm error npm-shrinkwrap.json with lockfileVersion >= 1.
```

## 🔧 Root Cause

The Dockerfile was trying to use `npm ci` command but the `package-lock.json` file was not being copied correctly in the build context.

## ✅ Solution

Updated the Dockerfile to properly copy the `package-lock.json` file and use the correct npm commands:

### Before (Problematic)
```dockerfile
# Copiar arquivos de configuração
COPY package.json package-lock.json* ./
COPY prisma ./prisma/

# Instalar dependências
RUN npm ci --only=production=false
```

### After (Fixed)
```dockerfile
# Copiar arquivos de configuração
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
COPY prisma ./prisma/

# Instalar dependências
RUN npm ci
```

## 📝 Changes Made

1. **Base Stage**: Fixed the copy instruction for `package-lock.json`
2. **Production Stage**: Fixed the copy instruction and npm command
3. **Removed invalid flag**: `--only=production=false` is invalid for `npm ci`

## 🚀 Build Process

The Docker build now follows these steps:

1. **Base Stage**:
   - Copy `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
   - Copy Prisma schema
   - Install all dependencies with `npm ci`
   - Generate Prisma client
   - Build Next.js application

2. **Production Stage**:
   - Copy built application files
   - Copy Prisma files and generated client
   - Copy `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
   - Install production dependencies with `npm ci --only=production`
   - Generate Prisma client again
   - Run as non-root user

## ✅ Verification

- ✅ Linting passes without errors
- ✅ Dockerfile syntax is correct
- ✅ All necessary files are included in the build context
- ✅ npm commands are properly configured

## 🎯 Benefits

- **Faster builds**: `npm ci` is faster than `npm install` in CI/CD
- **Reproducible builds**: Exact versions from `package-lock.json`
- **Smaller images**: Production-only dependencies in final stage
- **Security**: Non-root user execution

The Docker build should now work correctly with the remote PostgreSQL database configuration!
